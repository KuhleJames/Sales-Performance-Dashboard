# Project Overview
## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that analyses Superstore sales performance across key business dimensions â€” including sales, profitability, operations, and product-level insights. This dashboard is designed to support real-time decision-making by providing drill-down capabilities and intuitive visualisations tailored for the Regional Sales Director and other stakeholders.
## Business Context
The organisation currently relies on static, Excel-based reports that are time-consuming to update and offer limited visibility into trends and inefficiencies. As a result, business leaders struggle to:
 - Identify underperforming products or regions in a timely manner
 - Detect profit leaks caused by high discounting or returns
 - Understand seasonal or regional sales trends
 - Optimise operations such as shipping performance and order efficiency

This project addresses those challenges by transforming raw sales data into actionable insights through a clean, easy-to-use dashboard that delivers value across sales, operations, and profitability
